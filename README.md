## Recent updates

V5.5.0 is live with some great new features!
- Added the concept of "danger" buttons for those destructive actions
- SnackbarQueue is a new way to easily create notifications from anywhere in your app
- DialogQueue emulates the browsers built in alert, confirm, and prompt apis and gives you an easy way to create dialogs from anywhere in your app
- Full docs search has been added so make navigating a bit easier
- The docs have a new domain, rmwc.io
- Upgraded to material-components-web 2.x.x which includes a host of fixes and cleanup

V5 is officially out! RMWC has been completely rewritten in Typescript while also knocking out about a years worth of tech debt and improving things across the board. You can expect better typing, better performance, better integration with material-components-web, and just better everything. All of this was done with as few breaking changes as possible, so upgrading should be relatively painless.

Your quick migration guide:

- React 16.3 is the new min version to take advantage of React Fragments, Ref Forwarding, and the new Context Api. If you need React 15 support, you'll have to stay on 4.x.x and below.
- The library has been rewritten in Typescript instead of Flow. At this time, Flow types are no longer supported. Please comment on issue #407 If you're interested in bringing these back
- Changelog couldn't be generated for this release, see the release notes for the full details üöÄ https://opencollective.com/rmwc/updates/5-0-0-a-giant-leap-for-rmwc
